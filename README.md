# ðŸš— Gen 3 Smart Trip Logger & Dashboard

An ESP32-based smart automotive companion for the Toyota Prius Gen 3. This device interfaces with the vehicle's CAN bus to monitor, log, and display trip data, while also enhancing convenience and safety with automation features.

**Note:** For Google Sheets logging and dashboard features to function properly, the microcontroller must be connected to the internet via your phoneâ€™s hotspot.
